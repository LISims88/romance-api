     summary: "“In your pain, I see my own, so I'm going to tell you and only you, okay?”\n\nNever's past might be under control, but Ty's is just starting to unravel. After receiving a phone call from his broken past, tensions run high between Never and Ty, especially with Never deciding to do something she's never done and keep her pregnancy a secret.\n\nWhile visiting the skeletons in his dark, dark closet, Ty is threatened by all that he once was and all that he thought he'd overcome. With his pain about to consume him, Never is the only one who stands between Ty and relapse, who can help him control his emotions and find peace, but is she up to it? After all, with two tortured souls desperate for a healing touch, are they more of a hindrance to one another than a help?\n\nLove, marriage, and a baby. Three things that Ty and Never didn't see coming. It's judgment time for both of them, time to see if the light really can overcome the dark. Here's to hoping.\n\n“I know you'll make the right decision, no matter how hard it is, no matter if it cuts you into pieces, because you have to believe that I'll be there for you in the end.”",

He's aware that the feeling's mutual and the two don't think they'll ever see each other again, but when fate takes a hand and puts them both in the wrong place at the wrong time, Ty and Never form a tentative friendship that opens the door on their dark sides and shows them what it's like to live in the light.\n\n\"Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a few, careful steps back.\"",

It’s been forever since I’ve had a woman. Because of a storm rolling in, she’ll have to stay with me overnight. We could do a lot of filthy things in that time.

He’s vowed to spend each day living his life exactly how he chooses since the day his wife betrayed him and his four year military career turned into twenty.\n\nReturning home after retirement from the Marines, he’s traded the sand in the Middle East for that of the New Mexico desert, Humvees for a motorcycle, and the comradery of men in uniform for the occasional woman at his feet.\n\nLife was perfect until Makayla “Poison” Evans, Renegade MC Princess, knocked on his door, bruises on her face, neck, and arms, and no money to pay the cab driver. Pink hair, perfect body, and a mouth that Dom yearned to teach a million lessons, Mak asks more from him than he’s conceded to a woman in decades.\n\nShe needs his help, his protection, and against his better judgment, she expects him to keep her secrets. Only her secrets are deadly, dangerous, and have the potential to start a war between two MCs.\n\nAt what point does safeguarding a woman become a betrayal to the men Dominic calls his family? More importantly, can he get back the sanctity of his home once Makayla is no longer in the picture, or will he be forever tainted by her poison?",

He spanks her wiggling rear end and pulls her inside for more punishment. Rose Cooper gets caught breaking into a house and stealing during the worst snowstorm that Minnesota has seen in years. The reason she gets caught is that she's sick. She sneezes and coughs so much that she wakes the owner of the house. David Armstrong is surprised to find an attractive young thief trying to climb out of his dining room window. He yanks her back inside by the seat of her jeans while her accomplices take off. When he calls the police, he’s informed that they can’t come and collect her because of the storm. He has the option to either let her go, or to keep his uninvited guest safely inside until the police can come and fetch her. Because she doesn't look like a dangerous criminal, he sits her down and scolds her, giving her a long speech about respecting what other people have worked hard to obtain while he debates with himself what he should do with her. Rose cries because she’s afraid of the police. She doesn't want to go to jail or worse yet back to her mother and stepfather. He was the reason that she ran away in the first place. David suddenly notices that Rose isn't feeling well. He lays his hand on her forehead and notices that she has a raging fever. He swoops her into his arms and brings her into his bathroom while cursing himself for being so gullible. Caring for a sick patient wasn’t what he planned to do while on Christmas vacation from his internship from the hospital. He had wanted to fly home to his family, but he was stuck here because of the snowstorm. Finally, on Christmas Eve, Rose starts to feel better. David feels that now is a good time for them to talk about her bad behavior as well as take the necessary measures to correct her behavior and convince her to change her ways.",

     summary: "The ice planet has given me a second lease on life, so I'm thrilled to be here. Sure, there's no cheeseburgers, but I'm healthy and ready to be a productive member of the small tribe. What I didn't anticipate? That there'd be a savage stranger waiting nearby, watching me. And when he takes me captive, the unthinkable happens...I resonate to him.\n\nResonance means mating, and children...but I don't know if this guy's ever been around anyone before. He's truly a barbarian in all ways, right down to clubbing me over the head and claiming me as his own.\n\nSo why is it that I crave his touch and hunger for more?\n",
